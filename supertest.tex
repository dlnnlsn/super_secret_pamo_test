	Find all triples of integers $(x, y, p)$ such that $p$ is a prime, and
	\[
			y(x^2 + p) - x(y^2 + p) = p.
	\]


\item[2.] % Czech & Slovak MO 2018 Q1, C
	Thandi is filling the cells of a rectangular table alternately with crosses and circles (she starts with a cross).
	When the table is filled in completely, she determines her score as $X_r+X_c-O_r-O_c$ where $X_r$ is the sum of the squares of the number of crosses in each row, $X_c$ is the sum of the squares of the number of crosses in each column, $O_r$ is the sum of the squares of the numbers of circles in each row, and $O_c$ is the sum of the squares of the number of circles in each column.
	Find all possible values of the score for a $2019 \times 2019$ table.

Let $a$, $b$, and $c$ be positive integers that are the side-lengths of a non-degenerate triangle, and satisfy $\gcd(a, b, c) = 1$. Suppose that the fractions
\begin{align*}
	& \frac{a^2 + b^2 - c^2}{a + b - c}, && \frac{b^2 + c^2 - a^2}{b + c - a}, && \frac{c^2 + a^2 - b^2}{c + a - b}
\end{align*}
are all integers. Prove that the product of the denominators of the three fractions is either a square or twice the square of an integer.

\item[6.] % Turkish MO 2019 Q4
	In a triangle $ABC$, the interior angle bisector of $A$ intersects the excircle of $ABC$ opposite $A$ at points $D$ and $E$ such that $D$ lies on segment $AE$. Show that
	\[
		\frac{AD}{AE} \leq \frac{BC^2}{DE^2}.
	\]
